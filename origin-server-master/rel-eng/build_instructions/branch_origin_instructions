Git tagging procedure for OpenShift Origin

At the point in time the Origin Release is to happen, it will branch from
current stage. 

NOTE: These packages (and possibly others) are not currently included in
OpenShift Online and therefore are not increased in version by the Online
Release Engineering scripts.

These will need version incrementing either by hand or scripted.
FIXME: Script this.

rubygem-openshift-origin-dns-bind
rubygem-openshift-origin-dns-route53
openshift-origin-cartridge-mariadb
rubygem-openshift-origin-auth-kerberos
rubygem-openshift-origin-auth-mongo
openshift-origin-util

Increment the spec files by a significant digit to avoid git/tito tag conflicts.
#FIXME: Should probably make this more safe so that subsequent runs
#       won't accidently add another significant digit.

    find . -name \*.spec -exec sed -i 's/^\(Version\: .*\)$/\1.0/g' {} \;

Verify this looks good

    git diff

Tag everything

    declare -a failed_tags 
    for i in $(find . -name \*.spec); do   
        pushd $(dirname $i) &> /dev/null
            tito tag --accept-auto-changelog
            if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
                failed_tags+=( "$i" )
            fi
        popd &> /dev/null
    done
    printf "Failed tags: \n $i \n"

Need to push everything up to the openshift-origin-release-$num branch
as well as the tags.

    git push origin openshift-origin-release-$num
    git push --tags

From here, you can build.
