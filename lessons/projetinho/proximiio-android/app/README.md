# Proximi.io Android Demo App
This is a simple demo app for the Proximi.io platform.
Please note that this demo is designed to be used in Android Studio (Gradle is the keyword here).
To get started, create a new Android Studio project (API level 18), download this repository and import it as a module.
After that, download the Proximi.io Android Library repository and import it as a module (when importing, change the module name to :proximiioandroidlibrary).
